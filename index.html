            <p>Playing on the go for real money means you can fill the time on a journey or take a time out from a hectic day at work to grab some casino rewards. You can switch on to switch off, and this approach to playing online results for real money
                in shorter game sessions. <strong>Mobile apps are increasingly on par with their desktop cousins</strong>, but naturally, in some instances, this description falls wide of the mark. </p>
            <p>It&#8217;s true that the choice of free spins games is still likely higher on desktop, but it&#8217;s not the case at casinos such as JackpotCity. Of course, it&#8217;s one of the fully licensed online casinos, and the <strong>payout rates are quite high</strong>                compared to an average online casino in Canada. Besides, you can get the 100 match bonus on the go too. Its customer support is also very useful.</p>
            <h3 id="bonus">Welcome Bonuses and Other Offers to Look Out For</h3>
            <p>Playing online affords you the chance to pick and choose from hundreds of viable options and to play the real money games of the best online casinos. One of the biggest advantages that come with this, is the possibility to scour the various
                options in search of <strong>the biggest and best casino bonus offers</strong>. This subject can be a minefield, and it&#8217;s a prime reason to visit a site like this one, to get the lowdown. </p>
            <p>The terms and conditions of some casino offers are notoriously misleading and can sometimes seem deliberately inclined towards leaving you in a spin. Don&#8217;t be fooled by the big numbers of first deposit bonuses and free spins deals –
                <strong>the secret is in the wagering requirements</strong>. Even the best online casinos in can be guilty of dirty tricks, so arm yourself with the knowledge to defend yourself.</p>
            <p>Without further ado, and without getting into the nitty gritty, these are our picks for <strong>top casinos with the best first deposit bonuses</strong> out there:</p>

            <p>Sign up 100 match bonus offers at each online casino can only be used once and can often only be acquired by wagering on certain types of casino games. Online progressive slots lots like Mega Moolah are by far and away <strong>the best type of free spins game to play</strong>                for real money if you want to fulfill the wagering requirements in the most easy way possible, while video poker and blackjack bets tend to be limited in terms of how much they contribute to the requirements, often in the region of 10-20%.
                We should also mention that you must always go through the deposit methods qualifying for match bonuses, as many online casinos exclude e-wallets from the list.</p>
            <p>In addition to first deposit 100 match bonus offers, each online casino in Canada runs an assortment of regular promotions designed to keep existing casino Canadian players interested. Long-term real money Canadian players and big-spenders
                might be offered different loyalty program casino rewards, while new customers may encounter incentives such as <strong>daily login bonuses</strong>. Some casinos also offer easy to claim 100 match bonus offers specifically for live casino
                games. While no deposit bonuses do exist, you&#8217;ll discover there is always a catch. </p>
            <p>Without having to deposit, <strong>you can tuck into the games</strong> at a given online casino, but when you win real money, you might find you need to make a deposit in order to withdraw those winnings or nay winnings from the free spins.
                By the way, you can take a look at some of our other extensive casino reviews, such as the best <a href="">Canadian slots sites</a> and <a href="">roulette sites in Canada</a>.</p>
            <h4>Bonus Wagering Requirements: The Lowdown</h4>
            <p>No matter what promotion you choose, <strong>you must always keep the terms and conditions in mind</strong>. This is one of the important checks during each casino review. A little bit of reading goes a long way. To help you out, here&#8217;s
                an overview of the key bonus-related terms that might leave you unstuck:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Playthrough:</strong> To be eligible to receive the full stated bonus amount, you must wager the deposit amount, bonus amount, or both combined a specified number of times. Play through requirements are also known as wagering requirements,
                    and some of the <a href="">best online casino bonuses in Canada</a> offer ratios as low as 35x.</li>
                <li><strong>Min. Deposit:</strong> Bonuses that require a deposit will always come with a minimum deposit amount. Be aware that a stated minimum deposit might not be sufficient to get your hands on the full bonus amount. For example, the minimum
                    deposit could be C$10, but you need to deposit C$20 to access the full amount, meaning you are limited to 50%.</li>
                <li><strong>Game contribution:</strong> More often than not, casinos require real money Canadian players to play through the bonus or deposit amount on specified casino games. The game contribution is represented as a percentage, and the figure
                    for each game type will be listed on the website of the online casino in Canada. If the game contribution of roulette is set at 10%, and for online progressive slots it&#8217;s 100%, it means you&#8217;d have to wager ten times the
                    amount of cash on roulette to complete the same percentage of the playthrough.</li>
                <li><strong>Validity:</strong> Like a loaf of bread, welcome bonuses come with an expiration date. But there&#8217;s nothing tasty about having your chances to get a welcome bonus limited. From the moment you register, you&#8217;ll have a
                    time limit to complete the wagering requirements of the deposit bonus. This means you&#8217;ll have to get cracking right from the start. The validity of a welcome bonus is often in the range of 14 to 30 days, but it can vary.</li>
                <li><strong>Restricted payment methods:</strong> Be warned that the banking options including only deposit methods or other deposit and withdrawal payment options for available to be eligible for a welcome bonus with free spins are not always
                    the same as the options stated on the site. As we mentioned earlier, some bonuses might not be accessible by depositing using e-wallets, while others might be tied specifically to one or more deposit methods.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="payment">Payment Methods &#8211; E-Wallets, Credit Cards and Others</h3>
            <p>The top online casinos in Canada don&#8217;t want to give you any headaches when you sign up and make your first deposit, and it usually results in an ocean of deposit and withdrawal payment possibilities such as Visa and Mastercard payments.
                What&#8217;s more, given the intense competition for your attention, some casinos will go that extra step and give you a stab at a bonus by depositing with particular, sometimes obscure deposit methods. <strong>Bitcoin bonuses are not unheard of.</strong>                However, the main deposit methods you&#8217;ll almost always encounter at a safe and secure online casino in Canada are Visa Mastercard.</p>
            <div class="authorities-box">
                <ul class="authorities-list payment">
                    <li class="ico-visa">Visa</li>
                    <li class="ico-mastercard">MasterCard</li>
                    <li class="ico-neteller">Neteller</li>

                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>E-wallets like <strong>Skrill and Neteller have become very popular</strong> forms of depositing at casinos due to their speed and safety, while lately you can also charge your casino costs directly to your phone bill. Some Canadian online
                casino platforms allow you to top-up a prepaid card to facilitate hassle-free deposits, and the option of a direct bank transfer is another commonly accepted approach.</p>
            <h4>Making a Quick and Safe Deposit</h4>
            <p>When depositing funds at an online casino, <strong>safety is of utmost importance</strong>. The deposit methods mentioned above live Visa, MasterCard are all well-respected and highly trusted by new players and experienced gamblers around
                the world. You must understand that nowadays, all these methods are perfectly safe and secure and averagely fast. they are convenient for withdrawing free spins winnings as well. Still, there are some that are more popular and used than
                others for a number of reasons.</p>
            <p>We tend to lean towards Neteller as our preferred option because it has all the features of a modern but well-established among the online deposit methods: it conceals your banking details from the online vendor, it offers instant deposits
                without fees and has <strong>solid customer-protection policies</strong>. Learn more about the top Canadian online casinos with Neteller and you will find out all the important details that you need to know, including the best sites where
                you can deposit with this method. </p>
            <p><strong>The sign-up process is simple, secure and free</strong>, and it is rare for the best Canadian online casino platforms to charge upon Neteller deposits or withdrawals and fast payouts. As with many of the best online casinos in Canada,
                at JackpotCity there are no charges for all withdrawals methods, and your casino credits are available immediately after you&#8217;ve made your deposit.</p>

            </div>
            <h4>How to Withdraw Your Winnings</h4>
            <p>To cash out your free spins or cash winnings at an online casino, you have to wait for a verification process to be completed no matter which withdrawals methods you are using. The duration often ranges from one to three days and will be stated
                on your chosen casino&#8217;s website. The amount of withdrawal time varies from one deposit and withdrawal payment option to the next. Normally, e-wallets such as Neteller and Skrill are <strong>among the methods for fast payouts.</strong>.
                It&#8217;s also not unheard of for withdrawals to take a week or longer for some of the withdrawals methods. </p>
            <p>The online casino has to double-check the results of the game and the casino rewards earned in case an error occurred, and there are additional administrative duties to be performed before the <strong>payment can be processed</strong>. In
                case that the period of time is longer than what it should&#8217;ve been, you must definitely reach for the support centre of the online casino in CA and, from there, they will help you out. There can also be limits imposed by some withdrawal
                methods &#8211; but you are only likely to hear about those if you hit a jackpot and become an instant millionaire, which doesn&#8217;t happen all too often.</p>
            <h4 id="safety">RTP, RNG and Other Audit and Safety Seals</h4>
            <p>To obtain a valid license to operate one&#8217;s casino dealings, one must ensure complete transparency and be subject to <strong>regular audits by independent companies</strong>. Audits by firms such as <a href="" target="_blank" rel="">Thawte</a>                and <a href="" target="_blank" rel="">VeriSign</a> run tests to validate measures taken to protect user data, ensure safe monetary transactions, and confirm the fairness of the games. The return to player rate of online slots games such
                as Mega Moolah, for example, is a mechanical algorithm that determines a theoretical expected return of investment for punters spinning the reels. </p>
            <p>This figure is usually made available to consumers, and the settings that determine the fast payouts are rigorously tested by an independent adjudicator. Another advantage of playing at the top Canadian online casinos is that they all use
                state-of-the-art firewalls and <strong>high level of encryption</strong>, further ensuring the safety of their Canadian players. The most important thing to remember for the prospective real money Canadian players is to look out for the
                casino&#8217;s license number and check that number against those mentioned on the site of the <a href="" target="_blank" rel="">Kahnawake Gaming Commission</a>.</p>
            <h3>Real Canadian Customer Service</h3>
            <p>The importance of a casino&#8217;s customer relations cannot be overstated. It is one of the primary indicators of the quality and legitimacy of any online casino in Canada. Building trust and serving the needs of punters in distress is imperative
                for the gaming experience. The top casinos recognize this and dedicate plenty of resources towards building a rapid and efficient service to <strong>resolve the queries and complaints of their customers</strong>.</p>
            <p>Nowadays there are a plethora of options through which to contact a customer service department, and you should place a lot of value in companies that allow a good range of options, and <strong>in particular, live chat</strong>. With instant
                messaging or phone calls, there is nowhere to hide for an online casino in Canada, and their awareness of potential problems can be gauged. Some issues require an instant response, but if you are in no hurry, you can consider contacting
                the casino using email instead.</p>

            <h2 id="gambling">Gambling in Canada</h2>
            <p><strong>Gambling online in Canada is legal</strong> but operating a web-based casino from country&#8217;s territory is illegal. Even some of the <a href="">newest Canadian online casinos</a> are operated by offshore companies. All online operators
                operate from the native reserve of Kahnawake, which is considered to be an offshore territory despite its location across the river from Montreal. It&#8217;s a bizarre situation, but beneficial for the new players and skilled gamblers
                who want to enjoy their favourite games remotely. </p>
            <p>What&#8217;s more, some of the most respected and trusted offshore operators hold <strong>licenses from other gaming authorities</strong>, such as the UK Gambling Commission and Malta Gambling Authority support Canadian online casinos.</p>

            <h3 id="licences">Are Online Casinos in Canada Legal?</h3>
            <p>Online casino sites in Canada that offer attractive visa mastercard payout rates and free spins games must meet certain criteria to obtain a gambling license. <strong>The Kahnawake Gaming Commission</strong> is a special regulatory body with
                the right and responsibility to grant licenses to online video poker rooms, sportsbook websites and Canadian casino sites. It also ensures the criteria are met with a stringent vetting process.</p>
            <p>The legislation model used to regulate gambling in the country allows certain provinces to control and regulate the industry within their own borders. Since 2009, each province can decide whether or not to permit its citizens to participate
                in remote gambling activities. If you are under 19 years of age, you are not permitted to play for real cash online in Canada, except for in Quebec, Manitoba and Alberta where <strong>the legal minimum age is 18</strong>.</p>
            <h3 id="responsible">Gambling Responsibly</h3>
            <p>There is a network of charities and helpful resources for those Canadians who find their gambling habits are getting out of hand. Mke sure to consult them if you feel you have a problem. <a href="" target="_blank" rel="">The Responsible Gambling Council</a>                (RGC) is a non-profit and independent organization which focuses on preventing problem gambling. Based in Ontario, they organize awareness programs, pushing operators to adopt the <strong>best practices to help addicts</strong>. There&#8217;s
                also the Problem Gambling Institute of Ontario, which has <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="">a 24-hour help hotline listed on its website</a>. </p>
            <p><strong>The Best Canadian online casinos are monitored</strong> for signs of problem gamblers, and there&#8217;s also a mandatory self-exclusion feature in each casino. The latter allows Canadian players to simply cut their own access to the
                casino for a very long period of time, during which, even if they make an attempt to play for real money, the operator itself will not allow it.</p>
            <h3 id="history">History and Legislation</h3>
            <p>In 1892, <strong>every form of gambling was banned by the Canadian Criminal Code</strong>, however, things began to change less than ten years later. In 1900, raffles and bingo were permitted so long as they raised money for charitable causes,
                and another ten years after that, horse racing became legal. By 1925, gambling activities were permitted in fairs and exhibitions around the country.</p>
            <div class="full-width"><img src="/img/gambling-responsibly-in-canada.webp" alt="Gambling Responsibly in Canada - Legislation" width="1200" height="304" /></div>
            <p>The Criminal Code was amended again in 1969 to allow both the federal and provincial governments the chance to run lotteries to fund special projects. The first Canadian lottery was held in 1974 with the aim of raising money for the Montreal
                Olympic bid. Gradually through the 20th century, Canadian provinces and governments received more <strong>rights to run lotteries and horse racing events</strong>, plus open up new casinos replete with video slot machines. The legalization
                process became a trend and now casinos can be found in almost every province in the country.</p>
            <p>Fast-forward to the 21st century, and <strong>the perception of gambling has shifted further</strong>, thrusting semi-professional and online gaming into the mainstream. Nowadays it&#8217;s not uncommon for people of all backgrounds to be
                found stacking up chips in poker halls and online sites.</p>
            <p>Today, you don&#8217;t have to take any risks, as <strong>there are hundreds of trusted online casinos in Canada</strong>. There are also plenty more that aren&#8217;t trusted and fall into the so-called blacklist, which goes to show that
                many people want a slice of the pie. Internet gambling truly exploded in Canada, much like in many other countries where the practice is permissible. Canadians spend billions of Canadian dollars at the recommended online casinos, despite
                the fact that the operators are not actually based in the country at all.</p>
            <h3 id="resorts">Land-Based Casinos</h3>
            <p>Many of the top Canadian online casinos are part of much larger facilities that include elegant hotels, spas and restaurants, often flanked by natural beauty or fascinating historical sites. <strong>There are five casinos that stand out from the crowd</strong>                in terms of size, grandeur and importance. Arguably the most famous of these is <a href="" target="_blank" rel="">the Casino Niagara</a>, which is a casino of epic proportions to match the majestic waterfalls nearby. This beast has 95,00
                square feet of gaming space, including 1,500 online slots (With Mega Moolah on the list) and 40 gaming tables, accommodating blackjack, roulette and video poker. </p>
            <p>Other top destinations for Canadian new players include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Casino" target="_blank" rel="">Casino de Montreal in Quebec</a>, <a href="" target="_blank" rel="">Caesars Windsor Hotel &amp; Casino in Ontario</a>,
                <a href="" target="_blank" rel="">River Rock Casino Resort in British Columbia</a>. On the list are <strong>other popular resorts too</strong>. Those are <a href="" target="_blank" rel="">River Cree Resort and Casino in Alberta</a>, which
                doubles as a hockey center.</p>
